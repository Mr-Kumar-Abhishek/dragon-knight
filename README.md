- See @renderse7en's other project, [Dragon Scourge](https://github.com/renderse7en/dragon-scourge)!
- @Renderse7en hosts a [live demo](http://dragon.se7enet.com/) on his site. Check it out!
- Also, see the [original repo](https://github.com/renderse7en/dragon-knight) here on GitHub!

@Renderse7en, also known as Jamin Blount, had created an epic text-based RPG written in PHP. It was really early on in my self-learning that I found this old project, and used it to learn a lot of what I know today. In my love for PHP and my respect for @renderse7en's work, I've decided to fork the original repo - last updated 2 years ago - and evolve it with the knowledge of PHP I have today. No frameworks, no third-party scripts or classes; it's all new, fresh code.

# Requirements
- A decent text/code editor (we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode))
- PHP (5.4 and higher)
- a MySQL server (we recommend [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com))
- a web server, obviously. We can recommend using your computer or a Raspberry Pi and configuring it to serve via nginx. Otherwise, look at [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com).

# Installation
1. Clone this repo or download the zip.
2. Create a new database for Dragon Knight to use, if you don't already have one set up.
3. Edit 'resources/classes/database.php' to have the correct info for your database.
4. Upload the contents of the Dragon Knight folder to your site.
5. In your browser, run 'install.php' and follow the instructions.
6. After completing installation, delete 'install.php' from your Dragon Knight directory for security.
7. Enjoy the game!
