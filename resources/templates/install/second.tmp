<div class="alert info">
    It's all finished! Now, just because there might have been some errors, doesn't mean
    the installer didn't do what it needed to do. You can reuse this page of the installer
    to fix a broken database, since it will not overwrite any existing tables of the same
    names or data within any tables.
