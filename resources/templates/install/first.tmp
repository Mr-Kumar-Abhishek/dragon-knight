<h1>Installation, Page One</h1>

<div class="alert info">
    <b>Please note</b>, you must update the Database class in resources/classes/database.php to use
    your MySQL server's login information, as well as the name of the database you will use. This
    installer will create tables and put in data, but the database has to already exist.
</div>

<p>
    Installation for Dragon Knight is a simple two-step process: set up the database tables, then create 
    the admin user. After that, you're done.
</p>

<p>
    You have two options for database setup: complete or partial.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Complete Setup</b> includes table structure and all default data 
        (items, drops, monsters, levels, spells, towns) - after complete setup, 
        the game is totally ready to run.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Partial Setup</b> only creates the table structure, it does not populate 
        the tables - use this if you are going to be creating and importing your own 
        customized game data later.
    </li>
</ul>
